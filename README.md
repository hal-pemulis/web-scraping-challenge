# web-scraping-challenge
An application to scrape data about Mars, store it in a database, and display information from the DB to the user in a readable format. 

USER NOTE (IMPORTANT) :  For an unknown reason, the scrape function will occasionally stall after opening Chrome and produce an error. If this happens, simply reloading the page will fix the issue.
